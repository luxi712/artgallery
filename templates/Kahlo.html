							<h2>Henry Ford Hospital (1932) </h2>
							<h5> Located: Dolores Olmedo Collection, Mexico City, City </h5>
							<p class="card-text">Henry Ford Hospital, is a good example where the artist uses the
								ex-voto format but subverts it by placing herself centre stage, rather than recording
								the miraculous deeds of saints. Kahlo instead paints her own story, as though she
								becomes saintly and the work is made not as thanks to the lord but in defiance,
								questioning why he brings her pain. The artist demonstrates her need to be attached to
								all that surrounds her: to the mundane and metaphorical as much as the physical and
								actual. Perhaps it is through this reaching out of connectivity that the artist tries to
								be 'maternal', even though she is not able to have her own child.p>

							<h2>The Broken Column (1944) </h2>
							<h5> Located:Dolores Olmedo Collection, Mexico City,Mexico </h5>
							<p class="card-text">The Broken Column is a particularly pertinent example of the
								combination of Kahlo's emotional and physical pain. The artist's biographer, Hayden
								Herrera, writes of this painting, 'A gap resembling an earthquake fissure splits her in
								two. The opened body suggests surgery and Frida's feeling that without the steel corset
								she would literally fall apart'. A broken ionic column replaces the artist's crumbling
								spine and sharp metal nails pierce her body. The hard coldness of this inserted column
								recalls the steel rod that pierced the artist's vagina during her streetcar accident.
								More generally, the architectural feature now in ruins, has associations of the
								simultaneous power and fragility of the female body.

						<h2>The Two Fridas 1939</h2>
						<h5> Located: Museum of Modern Art, Mexico City,Mexico </h5>
						<p class="card-text">This double self-portrait is one of Kahlo's most recognized compositions,
							and is symbolic of the artist's emotional pain experienced during her divorce from Rivera.
							On the left, the artist is shown in modern European attire, wearing the costume from her
							marriage to Rivera. Throughout their marriage, given Rivera's strong nationalism, Kahlo
							became increasingly interested in indigenism and began to explore traditional Mexican
							costume, which she wears in the portrait on the right. It is the Mexican Kahlo that holds a
							locket with an image of Rivera. The stormy sky in the background, and the artist's bleeding
							heart - a fundamental symbol of Catholicism and also symbolic of Aztec ritual sacrifice -
							accentuate Kahlo's personal tribulation and physical pain.

							<h2>Self-portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) </h2>
							<h5> Located:Nikolas Muray Collection, Harry Ransom Center, the University of Texas at Austin</h5>
							<p class="card-text">The frontal position and outward stare of Kahlo in this self-portrait directly confronts and engages the viewer. The artist wears Christ's unraveled crown of thorns as a necklace that digs into her neck, signifying her self-representation as a Christian martyr and the enduring pain experienced following her failed marriage. A dead hummingbird, a symbol in Mexican folkloric tradition of luck charms for falling in love, hangs in the center of her necklace. A black cat - symbolic of bad luck and death - crouches behind her left shoulder, and a spider monkey gifted from Rivera, symbolic of evil, is included to her right. Kahlo frequently employed flora and fauna in the background of her bust-length portraits to create a tight, claustrophobic space, using the symbolic element of nature to simultaneously compare and contrast the link between female fertility with the barren and deathly imagery of the foreground. <

							<h2>The Wounded deer (1946) </h2>
							<h5> Located: Private Collection </h5>
							<p class="card-text">The 1946 painting, The Wounded Deer, further extends both the notion of chingada and the Saint Sebastian motif already explored in The Broken Column. As a hybrid between a deer and a woman, the innocent Kahlo is wounded and bleeding, preyed upon and hunted down in a clearing in the forest. Staring directly at the viewer, the artist confirms that she is alive, and yet the arrows will slowly kill her. The artist wears a pearl earring, as though highlighting the tension that she feels between her social existence and the desire to exist more freely alongside nature. Kahlo does not portray herself as a delicate and gentle fawn; she is instead a full-bodied stag with large antlers and drooping testicles. Not only does this suggest, like her suited appearance in early family photographs, that Kahlo is interested in combining the sexes to create an androgyne, but also shows that she attempted to align herself with the other great artists of the past, most of whom had been men.

						<h2>Weeping Coconuts
                            Cocos Gimientes (1951)</h2>
						<h5> Located:Los Angeles County Museum of Art </h5>
						<p class="card-text">This still life is exemplary of Kahlo's late work. More frequently associated with her psychological portraiture, Kahlo in fact painted still lifes throughout her career. She depicted fresh fruit and vegetable produce and objects native to Mexico, painting many small-scale still lifes, especially as she grew progressively ill. The anthropomorphism of the fruit in this composition is symbolic of Kahlo's projection of pain into all things as her health deteriorated at the end of her life. In contrast with the tradition of the cornucopia signifying plentiful and fruitful life, here the coconuts are literally weeping, alluding to the dualism of life and death. A small Mexican flag bearing the affectionate and personal inscription "Painted with all the love. Frida Kahlo" is stuck into a prickly pear, signaling Kahlo's use of the fruit as an emblem of personal expression, and communicating her deep respect for all of nature's gifts. During this period, the artist was heavily reliant on drugs and alcohol to alleviate her pain, so albeit beautiful, her still lifes became progressively less detailed between 1951 and 1953.
