							<h2>Big Self-Portrait (1967-68)</h2>
							<h5> Located:Walker Art Gallery of Ontario,Toronto </h5>
							<p class="card-text">Close turned to one of the oldest traditions anywhere in
								art history, the self-portrait. Close had partially set out to refute the
								critic Clement Greenberg's claim that it was impossible for an "advanced"
								artist to work in portraiture. Closes's untraditional approach involved
								conceiving of and creating a unique kind of "mug shot," a black-and-white
								idiom that exacerbated the subject's blemishes and the original photographic
								distortion caused by the camera.</p>

						<div class="card-body">
							<h2>Kent (1970) </h2>
							<h5> Located:Walker Art Gallery of Ontario,Toronto </h5>

							<p class="card-text">For Kent, Close made use of preparatory drawings for the
								first time to
								explore the three-color process, an imitation, or re-employment, of the
								photographic
								dye-transfer method. By adopting a mechanical procedure and mimicking it
								physically, or
								by hand crafting what is normally carried out by the camera, Close suggests
								that
								illusion is ultimately in the eye of the beholder, whose own optical
								apparatus finally
								"completes" the picture.

						<h2>Self-Portrait (1997)</h2>
						<h5> Located:Walker Private Collection </h5>
						<p class="card-text">The insouciant stare of the young man in Big
							Self-Portrait makes a striking counterpart to the stolid, knowing gaze of the older Close
							as represented in this self-portrait of 1997. Indeed, the comparison illustrates the
							evolution from fledgling artist to international icon.

						<h2>Big Nude (1967)</h2>
						<h5> Located: Collection Jon and Mary Shirley</h5>
						<p class="card-text">"Big Nude" is the first painting completed in Close's signature grid process, and both its size and self-conscious title indicate its ambitious nature. Although the transferred image "reads" as a flat transcription of light and dark characteristic of a photograph, the painting's variegated brushstrokes reveal Big Nude to be more of a prototype for future development than a fully resolved picture. Poised precariously between a common studio exercise in figure drawing and a 1960s girlie magazine shoot, "Big Nude" also challenges the future of representational painting at a moment in history when the genre would seem to have long ago exhausted its potential for future development. Only the antiseptic whiteness of the canvas hints at a new approach to the figure that might perfectly marry an instant, unforgiving photographic record of a subject with the artist's reconsideration of its every component over months of studied, methodical transcription.

						<h2>Keith/Mezzotint (1972) </h2>
						<h5> The Museum of Modern Art, New York </h5>
						<p class="card-text">
							The large format of Keith, although not nearly as large as Close's earlier portrait paintings, did not translate well to the outdated mezzotint process. Due to its gradual erosion, the plate made only ten good prints, and the surface coloring is noticeably lighter in the middle around the sitter's nose. The mezzotint printmaking process yields a soft, light-infused surface, here seen to best effect in Closes's rendering of the sitter's hair. The random effects typical of printmaking inspired Close to experiment further with various media.

					<h2>Fanny/
                        Fingerpainting 1985 </h2>
					<h5> Located:National Gallery of Art , Washington D.C</h5>
					<p class="card-text"> Close's enjoyment of the physical interaction between artist and material gave him a particular affinity for working in the fingerprint method. Criticized by some as a kitschy version of an art already informed by Pop, the unsophisticated technique, so reminiscent of child's play, seems doubly appropriate for this informal, yet subtly monumental portrait of the artist's grandmother. The numerous, individual touches of oil pigment gradually creating the appearance of supple flesh lends to the painting a sense of intimacy so appropriate to the underlying relationship between artist and his chosen subject.
